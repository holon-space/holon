//! Interpreter-level value type — `Value` plus reactive kinds.
//!
//! `Value` (in `lib.rs`) is the JSON-mirror datatype: it must stay
//! serializable and free of `Arc`s / signals / trait objects.
//! Reactive values are an interpreter-level concern, so they live in
//! this separate enum. Consumers at FFI / MCP / serde boundaries
//! always work in `Value`; consumers inside the render interpreter
//! work in `InterpValue`.
//!
//! See `~/.claude/plans/peaceful-strolling-muffin.md` for the design
//! rationale (why we do NOT add reactive variants to `Value` itself).
